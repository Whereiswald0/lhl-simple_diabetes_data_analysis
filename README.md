# lhl-simple_diabetes_data_analysis
Brief attempt to apply ML models to a small diabetes dataset

In this project, I have applied supervised learning techniques to a real-world data set and used data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis. The data set for this project is the "Diabetes" dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases The project involved the following tasks:

Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing: imported and cleaned the data set, analyzed and visualized the relationships between the different variables, handled missing values and outliers, and performed feature engineering as needed.
Supervised learning: used the Diabetes dataset to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not to a limited degree, using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Two models were selected, Logistical Regression and Random Forest, and their performance were compared.
The ultimate goal of the project is to gain insights from the data sets and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions based on the business questions asked.
